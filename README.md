# Overview

Digital payments have become an important part of everyday financial activity. UPI enables users to transfer money quickly, but the same convenience can also be exploited through fraudulent or abnormal transaction behaviour.

Traditional transaction-level analysis often focuses on individual properties such as:

- transaction amount
- transaction frequency
- transaction timestamp
- transaction location
- sender and receiver information

However, a transaction that appears normal when considered individually may become suspicious when viewed in the context of a user's historical behaviour.

For example, consider a user whose normal behaviour consists of:

```text
2–3 transactions per day
Average transaction amount: ₹300
Normal activity window: 09:00–20:00
```

If the same user suddenly performs:

```text
10 transactions
within a few minutes
with significantly larger amounts
```

the individual transactions may not provide enough context by themselves.

The behavioural pattern, however, is significantly different from the user's historical activity.

FraudLens is designed around this principle.

> Fraud detection should consider not only what a transaction is, but how it fits into the user's behavioural pattern.

---

# Problem Statement

## Digital Payment Fraud Detection Simulator

The objective of the project is to build a system capable of simulating digital-payment transactions and identifying potentially suspicious behaviour using machine learning.

The system analyses transaction behaviour through:

- transaction frequency
- transaction amount
- transaction timing
- transaction volume
- behavioural deviations
- short-duration transaction bursts
- user-level historical patterns

The project is implemented as a simulation platform rather than a production banking fraud-detection system.

---

# Solution

FraudLens implements an end-to-end behavioural anomaly detection pipeline.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Transaction Generation] --> B[Transaction Validation]
    B --> C[Transaction Storage]
    C --> D[Historical Transaction Data]
    D --> E[Behavioural Feature Engineering]
    E --> F[User Behaviour Profiles]
    F --> G[Isolation Forest]
    G --> H[Anomaly Score]
    H --> I[Risk Interpretation]
    I --> J[FastAPI Response]
    J --> K[Frontend Dashboard]
```

The system moves beyond simple transaction-level rules by incorporating historical behavioural context.

Instead of asking:

> Is this transaction large?

the system attempts to answer:

> Is this transaction behaviour unusual for this user?

---

# Objectives

The primary objectives of FraudLens are:

1. Simulate realistic digital-payment transaction behaviour.
2. Store transaction information for historical analysis.
3. Generate behavioural features from transaction history.
4. Detect anomalous behavioural patterns using machine learning.
5. Expose analysis through backend APIs.
6. Present detection results through an interactive frontend.
7. Maintain a clear separation between frontend, backend, ML and database responsibilities.
8. Provide a reproducible environment for demonstrating fraud-detection concepts.

---

# Key Features

## Transaction Simulation

The system provides a controlled environment for generating transaction activity.

Simulated transactions can contain information such as:

- user identifier
- transaction identifier
- amount
- timestamp
- transaction metadata
- behavioural information

Synthetic data makes it possible to demonstrate different fraud scenarios without requiring real financial data.

---

## Behavioural Analysis

Transaction history is aggregated to construct user-level behavioural profiles.

Relevant behavioural characteristics may include:

- transaction frequency
- average transaction amount
- transaction volume
- amount variation
- transaction timing
- activity bursts
- deviation from historical behaviour

---

## Machine Learning-Based Anomaly Detection

FraudLens uses Isolation Forest as its primary anomaly-detection algorithm.

The model is designed to identify observations that differ significantly from the learned distribution of normal behavioural data.

---

## User-Level Analysis

Rather than treating every transaction as completely independent, the system considers transaction activity in the context of a user.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A[Raw Transactions] --> B[Group by User]
    B --> C[Historical Behaviour]
    C --> D[Feature Engineering]
    D --> E[Behaviour Profile]
    E --> F[Anomaly Detection]
```

---

## Interactive Dashboard

The frontend presents information such as:

- transaction activity
- suspicious activity
- risk information
- user behaviour
- transaction trends
- detection results

The objective is to make the machine-learning output understandable to a human evaluator rather than exposing only raw model values.

---

# System Architecture

FraudLens follows a layered architecture.

```mermaid
flowchart TB
    U[User / Evaluator]

    F[Frontend]
    API[FastAPI Backend]
    ML[Machine Learning Engine]
    DB[(PostgreSQL Database)]

    U --> F
    F -->|HTTP / REST API| API

    API --> ML
    API --> DB

    ML --> API
    DB --> API

    API -->|JSON Response| F
```

The responsibilities of each layer are intentionally separated.

| Layer | Responsibility |
| ----- | -------------- |
| Frontend | User interface and visualization |
| FastAPI | API layer and application logic |
| ML Engine | Behavioural analysis and anomaly detection |
| PostgreSQL | Persistent transaction storage |
| Docker | Local database infrastructure |

---

# End-to-End Data Flow

The complete transaction-analysis flow is:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant Frontend
    participant API as FastAPI Backend
    participant DB as PostgreSQL
    participant ML as ML Engine

    User->>Frontend: Generate / submit transaction
    Frontend->>API: Send transaction request
    API->>API: Validate transaction
    API->>DB: Store transaction
    DB-->>API: Storage confirmation

    API->>DB: Retrieve relevant transaction history
    DB-->>API: Historical transactions

    API->>ML: Generate behavioural features
    ML->>ML: Run Isolation Forest
    ML-->>API: Anomaly result

    API->>API: Interpret risk
    API-->>Frontend: Analysis response
    Frontend-->>User: Display result
```

---

# Frontend

The frontend represents the presentation and interaction layer of FraudLens.

Its primary responsibilities are:

- presenting the dashboard
- accepting user interaction
- running the transaction simulator
- displaying transaction information
- displaying anomaly results
- visualizing behavioural information
- communicating with backend APIs

The frontend should not independently implement the fraud-detection logic.

The backend remains the source of truth for:

- transaction processing
- feature engineering
- model inference
- risk analysis
- persistent data

---

## Dashboard

The dashboard provides an overview of the system's current analytical state.

Potential dashboard information includes:

- transaction counts
- suspicious transaction counts
- behavioural statistics
- recent activity
- risk indicators
- anomaly results

---

## Transaction Simulator

The simulator provides a controlled mechanism for generating transactions.

The simulator is intentionally kept simple so that the main demonstration remains focused on:

1. transaction generation
2. backend processing
3. behavioural analysis
4. machine-learning detection
5. dashboard visualization

---

# Backend

The backend is implemented using FastAPI.

The backend acts as the central integration layer between the frontend, machine-learning pipeline and database.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Frontend Request] --> B[FastAPI Router]
    B --> C[Request Validation]
    C --> D[Business Logic]

    D --> E[Database Operations]
    D --> F[Feature Engineering]
    F --> G[ML Inference]

    E --> H[Response Construction]
    G --> H

    H --> I[JSON Response]
    I --> J[Frontend]
```

## Backend Responsibilities

The backend handles:

- API requests
- input validation
- transaction processing
- database operations
- historical data retrieval
- behavioural feature generation
- machine-learning inference
- risk interpretation
- API responses

---

# Machine Learning Pipeline

FraudLens uses an unsupervised anomaly-detection approach.

The core model is:

**Isolation Forest**

The overall ML pipeline is:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A[Transaction Dataset]
    B[Data Preprocessing]
    C[Behavioural Feature Engineering]
    D[Feature Matrix]
    E[Isolation Forest]
    F[Anomaly Score]
    G[Risk Interpretation]

    A --> B
    B --> C
    C --> D
    D --> E
    E --> F
    F --> G
```

The important distinction is that the model operates on behavioural information rather than relying only on raw transaction amounts.

---

# Why Isolation Forest

Isolation Forest is an anomaly-detection algorithm based on the principle that anomalous observations are easier to isolate than normal observations.

Consider a simplified behavioural dataset:

```text
Normal observations:

       ● ● ●
     ● ● ● ●
       ● ● ●

Anomalous observation:

                   X
```

The normal observations form a relatively dense region while the anomalous observation is separated from the majority of the data.

Isolation Forest constructs random decision trees and uses how quickly observations can be isolated as an indicator of abnormality.

---

## Why It Fits This Project

The project is primarily concerned with identifying unusual behavioural patterns.

A traditional supervised classification approach generally requires labelled examples such as:

```text
Normal
Fraud
```

A fraud-detection system can encounter difficulties when the available labelled data does not cover emerging or previously unseen fraud patterns.

Isolation Forest is useful for this prototype because it can perform anomaly detection without requiring every possible fraud scenario to be explicitly labelled.

It therefore aligns well with the project's objective:

```text
Learn normal behavioural patterns
             ↓
Identify unusual observations
             ↓
Flag potentially suspicious activity
```

---

# Behavioural Feature Engineering

Feature engineering is one of the most important parts of the system.

Raw transactions are transformed into behavioural information that can be consumed by the ML model.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Raw Transaction Data]

    A --> B[Data Cleaning]
    B --> C[Group Transactions by User]
    C --> D[Historical Aggregation]

    D --> E[Transaction Frequency]
    D --> F[Average Transaction Amount]
    D --> G[Amount Variation]
    D --> H[Transaction Volume]
    D --> I[Temporal Behaviour]
    D --> J[Transaction Bursts]
    D --> K[Behavioural Deviation]

    E --> L[Behavioural Feature Vector]
    F --> L
    G --> L
    H --> L
    I --> L
    J --> L
    K --> L

    L --> M[Isolation Forest]
```

---

## Example

Suppose a user historically behaves as follows:

```text
Average transaction amount: ₹350
Transactions per day: 3
Typical activity window: 09:00–20:00
```

The user's new activity is:

```text
12 transactions
within several minutes
with significantly larger amounts
```

A single transaction may not necessarily prove fraud.

However, the combined behavioural deviation can become an anomaly.

This is the type of contextual signal FraudLens attempts to identify.

---

# Fraud Simulation

Real banking and UPI transaction data is not appropriate for a public student/hackathon prototype because of privacy, security and data-access considerations.

FraudLens therefore uses synthetic transaction data.

This provides:

- privacy
- reproducibility
- controlled experimentation
- predictable scenarios
- easier testing
- repeatable demonstrations

---

## Simulated Behaviour Patterns

### Normal Activity

```text
Small and moderate transactions
distributed over normal time periods
with relatively stable user behaviour
```

### High-Value Anomaly

```text
Historically normal user
        ↓
Sudden unusually large transaction
```

### Transaction Burst

```text
Multiple transactions
within a short time period
```

### Behavioural Deviation

```text
Historical behaviour
        ↓
Sudden change in frequency / amount / timing
        ↓
Potential anomaly
```

---

# Risk Analysis

The ML model produces an anomaly-related output.

The backend converts that output into information that can be consumed by the application.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A[Transaction Behaviour] --> B[Feature Vector]
    B --> C[Isolation Forest]
    C --> D[Anomaly Score]
    D --> E[Backend Risk Interpretation]
    E --> F[API Response]
    F --> G[Dashboard]
```

The important distinction is:

> An anomaly is not automatically proof of fraud.

A legitimate user can perform an unusual transaction.

Therefore, in a real financial system, anomaly detection would normally be one component of a broader fraud-detection pipeline.

---

# Database

FraudLens uses PostgreSQL for persistent storage.

The repository includes Docker Compose configuration for running PostgreSQL locally.

The database stores transaction-related information required for historical analysis and application functionality.

---

## Why PostgreSQL?

PostgreSQL provides:

- relational data storage
- SQL querying
- transaction integrity
- indexing
- reliable persistence
- compatibility with SQLAlchemy
- straightforward local development

The database also provides a realistic separation between application state and the frontend.

---

# API Layer

The frontend communicates with the backend through HTTP APIs.

The general communication pattern is:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant F as Frontend
    participant A as FastAPI
    participant D as Database
    participant M as ML Engine

    F->>A: HTTP Request
    A->>A: Validate Request

    A->>D: Read / Write Data
    D-->>A: Database Result

    A->>M: Analyse Behaviour
    M-->>A: Anomaly Result

    A-->>F: JSON Response
```

The API layer serves as the contract between the frontend and backend.

This allows the frontend and backend to evolve independently as long as the API contract remains consistent.

---

cd UPIFraudDetection
```

---

# Backend Setup

Navigate to the backend:

```bash
cd backend
```

Create a virtual environment.

### Windows

```bash
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
```

### macOS / Linux

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

docker compose up -d
```

Verify the running containers:

```bash
docker ps
```

---

# Running the Backend

Navigate to the backend:

```bash
cd backend
```

Start the FastAPI application using the application's configured entry point.

For example:

```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

If the project's application entry point has a different module name, use the corresponding module.

The development server is typically available at:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:8000
```

FastAPI's interactive documentation is normally available at:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs
```

---

# Running the Frontend

Open a separate terminal.

```bash
cd frontend
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The terminal will display the frontend URL.

---

# Docker and PostgreSQL

Start the database:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

Stop the services:

```bash
docker compose down
```

Reset the database volume:

```bash
docker compose down -v
```

The final command deletes the persistent database volume and should only be used when intentionally resetting the development database.

---

# Machine Learning Training

The ML pipeline follows:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Historical Transaction Data]
    B[Preprocessing]
    C[Behavioural Feature Generation]
    D[Feature Matrix]
    E[Isolation Forest Training]
    F[Trained Model]
    G[Model Artifact]

    A --> B
    B --> C
    C --> D
    D --> E
    E --> F
    F --> G
```

The model should be trained using representative behavioural data.

The same feature-generation logic must be used during both training and inference.

---

# ML Inference

During inference, a new transaction is evaluated against behavioural information.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[New Transaction]
    B[Retrieve User History]
    C[Generate Behavioural Features]
    D[Apply Training Preprocessing]
    E[Isolation Forest]
    F[Anomaly Result]
    G[Risk Interpretation]

    A --> B
    B --> C
    C --> D
    D --> E
    E --> F
    F --> G
```

The key requirement is consistency between training and inference.

If the model was trained using one feature representation and receives a different representation during inference, the resulting predictions may become unreliable.

---

# Frontend-Backend Integration

FraudLens is designed around genuine frontend-backend communication.

The frontend should not contain hard-coded detection results as the source of truth.

The intended architecture is:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    F[Frontend]
    API[FastAPI API]
    DB[(PostgreSQL)]
    ML[ML Engine]

    F -->|HTTP Request| API
    API -->|Read / Write| DB
    API -->|Feature Data| ML
    ML -->|Detection Result| API
    API -->|JSON Response| F
```

This separation allows:

- frontend development without changing ML logic
- backend development without redesigning the UI
- independent model improvements
- centralized data processing
- consistent API responses

---

# Configuration

Configuration values should be provided through environment variables rather than hard-coded secrets.

Example:

```env
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/upi_fraud

API_HOST=127.0.0.1
API_PORT=8000
```

Do not commit real credentials or secrets to the repository.

For production deployment, use a dedicated secret-management mechanism.

---

# Testing

Testing should cover each layer independently and the complete system together.

## Backend Tests

Tests should cover:

- API validation
- transaction creation
- database operations
- feature engineering
- ML inference
- error handling

## Frontend Tests

Tests should cover:

- component rendering
- API communication
- loading states
- error states
- dashboard rendering
- transaction simulation

## End-to-End Testing

The complete workflow should be verified:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A[Frontend] --> B[API]
    B --> C[Database]
    B --> D[Feature Engineering]
    D --> E[ML Model]
    E --> B
    B --> A
```

---

# Security Considerations

FraudLens is a prototype and should not be deployed directly as a production banking system.

A production deployment would require additional security controls.

## Authentication

Production systems should implement:

- authentication
- authorization
- role-based access control
- secure session management
- token expiration

## API Security

Production APIs should include:

- HTTPS
- strict CORS configuration
- authentication
- authorization
- rate limiting
- request validation
- abuse protection
- structured logging

## Database Security

Development database credentials should never be reused in production.

Production deployments should use:

- strong credentials
- environment-based configuration
- secret management
- restricted database access
- encrypted connections

## Sensitive Financial Data

A real financial system would require strong controls around:

- encryption
- access control
- audit logs
- data retention
- data minimization
- regulatory compliance

---

# Limitations

FraudLens is a prototype and simulation platform.

It should not be interpreted as a production-ready fraud prevention solution.

## Synthetic Data

The system uses simulated transaction behaviour.

Real-world financial behaviour is significantly more diverse.

## Limited Fraud Coverage

The project focuses on behavioural anomalies rather than modelling every possible fraud category.

## Anomaly Does Not Mean Fraud

A detected anomaly represents unusual behaviour.

It does not establish that a transaction is fraudulent.

```text
Anomaly ≠ Confirmed Fraud
```

## Model Limitations

Isolation Forest is useful for anomaly detection, but no single algorithm can capture every fraud pattern.

A production system would likely combine multiple detection techniques.

## Simulation Limitations

The simulator provides controlled scenarios rather than live UPI infrastructure or real banking transactions.

---

# Future Scope

## Real-Time Transaction Processing

A future version could introduce an event-streaming architecture.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A[Transaction Event] --> B[Kafka / Event Stream]
    B --> C[Fraud Detection Service]
    C --> D[ML Model]
    D --> E[Risk Engine]
    E --> F[Real-Time Alert]
```

---

## Hybrid Fraud Detection

Multiple detection techniques could be combined:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Transaction]

    A --> B[Rule Engine]
    A --> C[Isolation Forest]
    A --> D[Supervised ML]
    A --> E[Graph Analysis]

    B --> F[Risk Engine]
    C --> F
    D --> F
    E --> F

    F --> G[Final Risk Assessment]
```

---

## Graph-Based Fraud Detection

Future versions could model relationships between:

- users
- accounts
- devices
- transactions
- beneficiaries

This could help identify coordinated transaction networks and suspicious account clusters.

---

## Explainable AI

Instead of displaying only:

```text
HIGH RISK
```

the system could provide explanations such as:

```text
Transaction frequency increased significantly.

Transaction amount is substantially above
the user's historical average.

Recent activity differs from the established
behavioural baseline.
```

This would make the system more useful to fraud analysts.

---

## Adaptive Behaviour Profiles

A future version could continuously update the user's baseline.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A[Historical Behaviour] --> B[Behaviour Baseline]
    C[New Transactions] --> D[Current Behaviour]
    B --> E[Behaviour Comparison]
    D --> E
    E --> F[Anomaly Detection]
    F --> G[Updated Behaviour Profile]
    G --> B
```

---

## Real-Time Alerts

Potential future alert channels include:

- dashboard notifications
- email
- SMS
- push notifications
- analyst review queues

---

# Demo Flow

A recommended project demonstration is:

## 1. Open the Dashboard

Show the main FraudLens dashboard.

Explain that the dashboard represents the monitoring and analysis layer.

## 2. Demonstrate Normal Activity

Generate normal transactions.

Explain that the system establishes behavioural context from transaction history.

## 3. Trigger Suspicious Behaviour

Generate an unusual transaction pattern.

For example:

```text
Multiple transactions
+
Unusual transaction amount
+
Short transaction interval
+
Behavioural deviation
```

## 4. Show Backend Processing

Explain:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A[Transaction] --> B[FastAPI]
    B --> C[Feature Engineering]
    C --> D[Isolation Forest]
    D --> E[Risk Result]
    E --> F[Frontend]
```

## 5. Show the Detection Result

The dashboard displays the resulting analysis.

Highlight:

- affected user
- transaction
- behavioural deviation
- anomaly result

## 6. Explain the ML Choice

The key explanation is:

> Isolation Forest was selected because the project focuses on anomaly detection. Instead of requiring every possible fraud pattern to be explicitly labelled, the model identifies observations that differ significantly from normal behavioural patterns.

## 7. Demonstrate the Architecture

Show that the application follows:

```text
Frontend
   ↓
REST API
   ↓
Backend
   ↓
Database + ML
   ↓
REST Response
   ↓
Frontend
```

This demonstrates that the dashboard is connected to the application backend rather than simply displaying predefined results.

---

# Development Workflow

The recommended development workflow is:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Feature Requirement]
    B[API Contract]
    C[Backend Implementation]
    D[Database / ML]
    E[Frontend Integration]
    F[End-to-End Testing]
    G[Demo]

    A --> B
    B --> C
    C --> D
    D --> E
    E --> F
    F --> G
```

The API contract should be established before frontend and backend teams implement their respective components.

---

# Design Principles

## Separation of Concerns

```text
Frontend
    ↓
Presentation

Backend
    ↓
Business Logic

ML
    ↓
Detection

Database
    ↓
Persistence
```

## Reproducibility

Synthetic transaction generation allows fraud scenarios to be reproduced consistently.

## Explainability

Detection results should be accompanied by behavioural information wherever possible.

## Modularity

The ML component can evolve independently from the frontend.

## Scalability

The API and database separation provides a foundation for future event-driven and distributed architectures.

---

# Core Technical Concept

The central concept of FraudLens can be summarized as:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Transaction] --> B[Transaction Context]
    B --> C[User Behaviour]
    C --> D[Behavioural Features]
    D --> E[Anomaly Detection]
    E --> F[Potentially Suspicious Activity]
```

The project therefore moves from:

```text
Transaction-Based Analysis
```

towards:

```text
Behaviour-Based Anomaly Detection
```

---

# Current Status

FraudLens currently provides the core architecture for:

- frontend/backend separation

# Project Information

**Project:** FraudLens — UPI Fraud Detection and Transaction Analysis Platform

**Repository:**
https://github.com/Atul-Kumar29/UPIFraudDetection

**Primary Concept:**

Feature Engineering

Isolation Forest
       ↓
Anomaly Detection
       ↓
Risk Analysis

```

The fundamental idea behind FraudLens is to identify potentially suspicious activity by understanding **how a transaction fits into a user's behaviour**, rather than evaluating the transaction in isolation.
